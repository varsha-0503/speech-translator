This project is a speech-to-text translator built with Python. It allows you to speak into your microphone, converts the speech to text, translates it into your chosen language, and logs it into a CSV file.

Features:
- Converts spoken words into text using speech recognition.
- Translates the recognized text into a chosen language.
- Saves the original and translated text in a CSV file with a timestamp.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- speech_recognition
